# Information
Assets proxy does not do much. It is just an "admin panel" for displaying and editing json files requested from a server.
It only works alongside [assets-server](https://github.com/dimoiko100/assets-server) which is a very small server that is
responsible for serving and storing json files

The main purpose of those two projects is the management of small projects, mostly hosted in shared hosting servers.

## Installation \[WIP\]
Run server

```make run```

Build vue bundle

```make build-client```

Run development client server

```make run-dev-client```
